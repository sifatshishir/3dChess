## General info
I developed a 3D chess game using React and Three.js. The game features a fully functional chess board with pieces that can be moved by the user. The game also features a 3D camera that can be rotated around the board, allowing users to view the board from any angle. This project showcases my expertise in building complex web applications using modern front-end technologies and delivering high-quality, visually stunning user interfaces.<br/>
